# Covid19_India_Analysis

Two Covid Datasets (JSON format) were used to extract data.

Dataset - 1: -

https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/data.min.json

DataSet - 2: -

https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/timeseries.min.json

I used Python to extract the data and convert it into csv format from the json files.
Used Python Libraries: - Pandas, Requests, Numpy, and JSON

PFA related file of data extraction: - (“Covid_Project_json_to_csv.ipynb”)

Extracted and cleaned multiple tables are stored in “Cleaned Extracted Data” folder.

Used SQL and Excel to get insights from those tables. “Covid_Project.sql” file contains all sql
queries used to derive insights.

Also used some statistics for getting some statistical insights like correlations, rates of deaths,
Etc. This part was done in Excel.

“Project_dashboard.xlsx” file contains the summarised Dashboard. There are multiple
dashboards in this file which are interactive.
